name: No Thanks!
version: 0.1.0
instructions: Take a card or pay one chip as you try to avoid points. If you
  take the card you get its points, but points are bad. But you also get the
  chips that others have played to avoid taking the card, and that’s good (each
  chip cancels out one point). And there's one more twist: If you collect cards
  in sequence, only the lowest one counts against your score. So say, “No
  thanks!” and play your chips, but watch out: When you’re out of chips that
  card’s all yours. You'll also need 55 counters. Shuffle the cards and put 9
  back in the box, these won't be used. For 3-5 players, give 11 counters
  each. For 6 players, give 9 counters each. For 7 players, give 7 counters
  each. You're allowed to hide your counters.
