name: Insider
version: 0.1.0
instructions: Do we really have free will? Who decides this? Are we controlled
  by what we hear and what we see, even while thinking we decide freely?
  Insider is a game that deals with these questions. While communicating to
  others, you have to find the right answers to a quiz or find the "insider"
  who is manipulating the discussion. The insider will do everything to hide
  their identity while misleading the others.

  In more detail, players are assigned roles at random. One player is the
  "master", and they secretly select a word from a set given in a deck of
  cards. (In a variant given in the rulebook, they can freely select and write
  down a word.) The "insider" player, whose role is not known to the other
  players, will then secretly view the word. The rest of the players are known
  as "commons". The commons then have approximately five minutes in which to
  ask the master "yes" or "no"-type questions so that they can deduce the
  secret word. The insider attempts to secretly lead the commons towards the
  correct word. If the commons fail to guess the correct word, everyone loses.

  If, however, the word is correctly guessed in the allowable time, the master
  flips the sand timer, and the commons and master have until the sand runs out
  to discuss the game and deduce the identity of the insider. If they guess
  correctly, they win the game together; if they do not, the insider wins.
