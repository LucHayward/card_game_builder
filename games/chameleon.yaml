name: Chameleon
version: 0.1.0
instructions: Each player says one word aloud to describe on of the cards from
  a given expansion. All players are referring to the same card, except for the
  chameleon who doesn't know which card they're meant to be describing. Once
  everyone has said their word, debate and try to find out who is the
  chameleon. The players win if they find the chameleon, the chameleon wins if
  the players can't find them or if they manage to figure out the card after
  they've been found.
