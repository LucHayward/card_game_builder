name: Fake Artist goes to New York
version: 0.1.0
instructions: Players take turns being the Question Master, whose role is to
  set a category, write a word within that category on dry erase cards, and hand
  those out to other players as artists. At the same time, one player will have
  only an "X" written on his card: they are the fake artist!

  Players will then go around the table twice, drawing one contiguous stroke
  each on a paper to draw the word established by the Question Master, then
  guess who the fake artist is. If the fake artist is not caught, both the fake
  artist and the Question Master earn points; if the fake artist is caught and
  cannot guess what the word is, the artists earn points.
