# Each round, there's one fake artist and everyone else is a real artist.
# Everyone draws the same card describing something (like a house, cart,
# computer, etc) except the fake artist's card will be blank (nobody else 
# knows who the fake artist is). The players then take it in turn drawing
# the object on the card line by line. If the real artists can guess who 
# the fake artist is, then they win. But if the fake artist can guess
# what the object they're all drawing is before they're found out, then the
# fake artist wins
